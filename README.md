# 📞 Call Centre Performance Analysis Dashboard 
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents an end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Power BI to analyze a call centre's operations. The goal was to transform a static Excel dataset into a dynamic, interactive dashboard that provides a clear view of performance metrics, agent productivity, and customer satisfaction.    
By leveraging Power BI's data modeling and DAX capabilities, the dashboard uncovers insights that support operational efficiency, resource optimization, and improved customer service delivery.

## 🎯 Project Objectives    
✅ Visualize call traffic patterns across days and time slots to identify high-demand periods.   
✅ Evaluate individual agent performance using metrics like average talk time and number of calls answered.      
✅ Measure overall customer satisfaction and call resolution effectiveness.    
✅ Reduce operational inefficiencies by identifying bottlenecks (e.g., call abandonment).    
✅ Build a dashboard that supports strategic decision-making with real-time insights.     

## ❓ Key Business Questions    
1️⃣ What is the overall customer satisfaction rate?   
2️⃣ What percentage of calls are answered vs. abandoned?   
3️⃣ When is the call center busiest and least busy?   
4️⃣ Which agents are performing best in terms of responsiveness and efficiency?   
5️⃣ What proportion of calls are successfully resolved?   
6️⃣ How can these metrics inform better staffing and training decisions?   

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
✅ **Customer Satisfaction**: Averaged 3.40 / 5 (~68%), indicating moderate satisfaction with room for growth.

📈 **Peak Call Times**: The busiest hour is 13:00 (1 PM); the least busy is 18:00 (6 PM).

📆 **High-Volume Day**: Monday sees the highest call volume, indicating a possible backlog from the weekend.

📉 **Call Abandonment Rate**: Stands at 18.92%, potentially due to long wait times during peak hours.

🎯 **Agent Performance**: **Jim** answered the most calls (536), showing strong responsiveness.

  **Becky** achieved the fastest average speed of answer (65.3s), indicating efficiency.

🟢 **Resolution Rate**: 81.08% of calls were resolved successfully.

## 🧠 Recommendations:   
✔ **Optimize Staffing**: Align staffing schedules with peak periods (e.g., 13:00–14:00 on Mondays) to reduce call wait times and abandonment.

✔ **Performance Coaching**: Use agent performance data to offer tailored feedback and coaching, especially for those with high talk times or low resolution rates.

✔ **Enhance Resolution Processes**: While the resolution rate is high, aiming for >90% can further boost satisfaction. 

✔ **Monitor Underutilized Periods**: Shift some operations or outbound activities to quieter hours (e.g., 6 PM).


## 🧾 Summary & Conclusion
The Power BI Call Centre Dashboard demonstrates the power of data storytelling in operational analytics. By uncovering trends in **call volume**, **agent responsiveness**, and **customer resolution**, the dashboard equips decision-makers with insights to act quickly and strategically.

From identifying when and where to deploy resources, to evaluating service effectiveness, this project proves how Business Intelligence tools like Power BI can drive real impact in customer service environments.
